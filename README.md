\# PlethoAI — Contextual, Ethical Clinical Logic



PlethoAI is a growing clinical reasoning engine designed to honor the full

complexity of human health. It rejects reductive, essentialist approaches to

race and identity, and instead centers context, lived experience, and structural

factors as meaningful components of care.



This project began as a simple triage exercise and is evolving into a modular,

population-aware framework that can incorporate cultural identity, community

background, environmental exposures, and situational factors such as veteran

status or chronic stress.



PlethoAI does not treat identity as biology; it treats identity as context — a

lens through which care is shaped, not predetermined.
